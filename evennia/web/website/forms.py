class CharacterForm(ObjectForm):
    """
    This is a Django form for Evennia Character objects.

    Since Evennia characters only have one attribute by default, this form only
    defines a field for that single attribute. The names of fields you define should
    correspond to their names as stored in the dbhandler; you can display
    'prettier' versions of the fieldname on the form using the 'label' kwarg.

    The basic field types are CharFields and IntegerFields, which let you enter
    text and numbers respectively. IntegerFields have some neat validation tricks
    they can do, like mandating values fall within a certain range.

    For example, a complete "age" field (which stores its value to
    `character.db.age` might look like:

    age = forms.IntegerField(
        label="Your Age",
        min_value=18, max_value=9000,
        help_text="Years since your birth.")

    Default input fields are generic single-line text boxes. You can control what
    sort of input field users will see by specifying a "widget." An example of
    this is used for the 'desc' field to show a Textarea box instead of a Textbox.
