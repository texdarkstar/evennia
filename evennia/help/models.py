Models for the help system.

The database-tied help system is only half of Evennia's help
functionality, the other one being the auto-generated command help
that is created on the fly from each command's `__doc__` string. The
persistent database system defined here is intended for all other
forms of help that do not concern commands, like information about the
game world, policy info, rules and similar.
