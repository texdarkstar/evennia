"""
This module brings Django Signals into Evennia. These are events that
can be subscribed to by importing a given Signal and using the
following code.

THIS_SIGNAL.connect(callback, sender_object)

When other code calls THIS_SIGNAL.send(sender, **kwargs), the callback
will be triggered.

Callbacks must be in the following format:

def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
    ...

This is used on top of hooks to make certain features easier to
add to contribs without necessitating a full takeover of hooks
that may be in high demand.
